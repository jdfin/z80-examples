Z80 examples/tests for my breadboard Z80.

Unlikely to be of interest to anyone else;
repo is public so I can import to ASM80.

Build using [ASM80](https://www.asm80.com/):
- `Import repo from GitHub`
- `https://github.com/jdfin/z80-examples`
- Pick one of the files to run
- `Compile` then flash using the generated hex file
